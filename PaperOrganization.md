# Paper Organization
- Section 1:
	- Short Abstract
	- Introduction, based on 'research report' article type from PNAS
	- Significance Statement
- Section 2: Overview of Pipeline. Include theorems about ECT and cones. No algorithmic details, include pseudocode in the SI.
	- Representation of EC
	- nonparametertic Bayesian variable selection
	- sub image mapping
- Section 3: Simulation/ Real Data Analysis. Dropping New vs. Old comparisons (3e. of previous outline on slack)
	- Simulations with spheres
	- Caricatures of Teeth
	- New World Classifications
- Section 4: Discussion

# Figures
Figure 1: Schematic.

- Panel I: Teeth for two classes, side by side
- Panel II: Computing Summary Statistics: Cone moving around tooth on left of panel, generating EC curve on right of panel. Should show the sublevel filtration.
- Panel III: EC curves for two classes
- Panel IV: Reconstruction, as from Lab Meeting presentation
- Panel V: Teeth with reconstructed regions.

Or we could combine Panels II,III:

- Panel I: Teeth for two classes, side by side
- Panel II: Computing Summary Statistics: Cone moving around tooth on left of panel, generating EC curves of both classes on right of panel. Should show the sublevel filtration.
- Panel IV: Reconstruction, as from Lab Meeting presentation
- Panel V: Teeth with reconstructed regions.

- Panel III (bottom left): Caricatured Teeth with highlighted caricatured regions
- Panel IV (bottom right): ROC curves
